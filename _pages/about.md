I am a PhD student advised by [Sam Burden](https://faculty.washington.edu/sburden/bio/).

Through my research I want to help improve the lives of people with disabilities, exploring topics like improved prosthetics feedback and brain-computer interfaces.
My work is very interdisciplinary spanning neural engineering, signal processing, machine learning, and control systems theory.
I love learning, and prefer to focus more on the potential impacts of my work than restrict myself to a specific field.

I did my BS/MS in Computer Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, working at the cutting edge of human-robot interaction and additive manufacturing. 
I was a [SOURCE STEM Scholar](https://case.edu/humanfusions/Ishika%20source%20stem%20scholarship) and winner of the [Robert L. Shurter Prize](https://case.edu/humanfusions/Ishika%20Kanakath).
Under the mentorship of Prof. Alexis E. Block, I researched how interaction modalities affect human perception and comfort during human-robot collaboration — using Baxter robots to build more socially aware systems.
