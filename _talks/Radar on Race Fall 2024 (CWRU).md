## Overview
Presented our innovative Doppler radar velocity measurement system at CWRU's SOURCE (Support of Undergraduate Research and Creative Endeavors) STEM conference, demonstrating how undergraduate engineering research can address real-world community needs through cost-effective technological solutions.


## Abstract
The Cleveland Big Wheels Relay, an annual fundraiser for the Cleveland Hearing and Speech Center, lacked affordable real-time velocity measurement capabilities to enhance spectator engagement. Commercial radar guns ($80-$200) are prohibitively expensive and lack audience display features. Our team developed a custom Doppler radar system using the HB100 microwave sensor (10.525 GHz) integrated with an ESP32 microcontroller, achieving comparable functionality at just $30.25 in components. The system features custom signal amplification circuitry, real-time Bluetooth data transmission, and dual-lane monitoring capabilities specifically designed for relay racing formats.

## Key Technical Highlights Presented

Signal Processing Innovation: Designed a two-stage operational amplifier circuit providing 40dB gain to amplify microvolt-level Doppler signals

Wireless Integration: Implemented Bluetooth Serial communication achieving 3.55-second connection time with 60-foot range
Cost Optimization: Reduced implementation cost by 85% compared to commercial solutions through efficient component selection and system consolidation
Real-Time Performance: Achieved sub-millisecond processing latency for velocity calculations using optimized DSP algorithms

## Research Impact
This project demonstrates the successful application of electromagnetic theory, signal processing, and embedded systems design to create accessible technology for community organizations. While encountering challenges with noise interference,the project provided valuable insights into real-world signal processing constraints and the importance of robust filtering techniques in electromagnetic applications.
